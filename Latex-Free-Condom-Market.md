This growth can be attributed to the increasing acceptance and availability of innovative condom products. These alternatives, such as condoms made from synthetic materials like polyurethane and polyisoprene, offer similar levels of protection while eliminating latex allergens. As awareness around sexual health improves, both in developed and emerging markets, the demand for latex-free condoms is poised for further acceleration. Manufacturers are responding by investing in research and development to improve the comfort, safety, and effectiveness of their products, as well as introducing eco-friendly, sustainable options, which also appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.
